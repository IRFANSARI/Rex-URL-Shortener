# Rex-URL-Shortener
As you have already guess, Rex URL Shortener is a url shortenting website. I made this this website to learn about backend and databse. I used Node JS, Express JS, MySQL and more technologies to make to this project. <br/>
By the way, I have written the whole documentation to install and use this project. <br/>
It was just a fun project, but hey if you find something that I should change feel free to send a PR. <br/>
Have Fun Guys !!! <br/>

Here is the live website link: https://rex-url-shortener.onrender.com/
